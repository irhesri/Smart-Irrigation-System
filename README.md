# Part 1: Irrigation System
In this part we are gonna assemble the components and develop a code to enable the arduino to collect soil moisture data in order to determine whether to turn on or, off pump. Upon detecting a low moisture level, the Arduino must intervene by activating the pump to supply water for the plant.
## Equipments

### I- Soil Moisture Sensor:
>>>>>>>>>> ---
   #### *1. Introduction:*
  A soil moisture sensor is capable of measuring the moisture content in the   surrounding soil. It proves to be a valuable tool for keeping track of your garden or plant's water levels, making it an essential component of a smart garden.
  
<p align="center">
  <img alt="soil moisture sensor" src="https://github.com/irhesri/Smart-Irrigation-System/blob/main/Part1%3A%20Irrigation%20System/Equipments/Soil%20Moisture%20Sensor.jpg">
</p>

This sensor employs two probes to transmit current through the soil and subsequently gauge the resistance to determine the moisture level. Increased water content enhances soil conductivity, resulting in easier electricity flow (lower resistance), whereas dry soil exhibits poor conductivity, leading to higher resistance.
  #### *2. Specifications:*
  - Required voltage for working: 5V
  - Required current for working: <20mA
  - Required working temperature: 10°C~30°C
  - Type of interface: Analog
  - Depth of detection: 37mm
  #### *3. Mounting:* 
  
<p align="center">
  <img alt="soil moisture sensor mounting" src="https://github.com/irhesri/Smart-Irrigation-System/blob/main/Part1%3A%20Irrigation%20System/Equipments/Soil%20Moisture%20Sensor.png">
</p>

  #### *4. Code Functions:*
In order to use our moisture sensors it is necessary for us to perform a calibration process. It appears that each of these devices possesses its qualities and even sensors obtained from the same batch may have varying characteristics.
  :bulb: **Sensor Calibration**:
Calibration is a straightforward procedure involving determining the sensor's analog output under two conditions:
Dry Value - Exposed to air with minimal humidity.
Wet Value - Completely submerged in water.
- The calibration code is quite simple. In our code, we merely read the sensor value and print it to the serial monitor. After a brief pause, we repeat the entire process:
  
  ``` ino
  #define sensor_pin A0

  void  setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600);
  }

  void  loop() {
    int  sensor_analog = analogRead(sensor_pin);
    Serial.println(sensor_analog);
    delay(1000);
  }
  ```
  Run the code and keep an eye on the serial monitor. Record the values in both damp and dry environments.
  
 *Dry Value*
 
  <p align="center">
    <img alt="serial monitor dry value" src="https://github.com/irhesri/Smart-Irrigation-System/blob/main/Part1%3A%20Irrigation%20System/Code/SensorDryValue.png">
  </p>
  
  *Wet Value*
  
   <p align="center">
    <img alt="serial monitor wet value" src="https://github.com/irhesri/Smart-Irrigation-System/blob/main/Part1%3A%20Irrigation%20System/Code/SensorWetValue.png">
   </p>
   
  1- Read sensors values:
  ``` ino
  moistureValue = analogRead(moistureSensorPin);
  ```

  2- Determine soil moisture percentage:
  ``` ino
  moisturePercentage = map(moistureValue, DryValue, WetValue, 0, 100);
  ```
  
  3- Make sure that the value is between 0 and 100:
  ``` ino
  moisturePercentage = constrain(moisturePercentage, 0, 100);
  ```

  ### II- Relay:
>>>>>>>>>> ---
  #### *1. Introduction:*
  The 5V relay is an electromechanical switch that enables the Arduino Uno to regulate devices, such as water pumps, based on low-power signals. In the smart irrigation system, the relay serves as the interface between the Arduino Uno and the irrigation mechanism, enabling the automated activation and deactivation of the pump.

# Part 3: Monitoring the water level in the tank
This part aims to monitor the water level in a reservoir by measuring the distance between the sensor and the reservoir bottom. Based on this water level, I programmed a visual indicator using an RGB LED, which changes color to reflect the water level variation. When the level is low, the LED displays a red hue, then transitions to orange, yellow, greenish, and finally green when the reservoir is full. This approach provides a clear and intuitive visualization of the water level, making reservoir supervision easier without requiring constant physical inspection. 

## Equipments

### I- HC-SR04:
>>>>>>>>>> ---
   #### *1. Introduction:*
  
<p align="center">
  <img alt="HC-SR04" src="https://github.com/irhesri/Smart-Irrigation-System/blob/main/Part3%3A%20Monitoring%20the%20water%20level%20in%20the%20tank/Equipements/HC-SR04.jpg">
</p>

This sensor is used to calculate the distance to an object.
- Calculating the distance using HC-SR04
We determine the time required for the sensor to reach the object and return, allowing us to calculate the distance using the following formula:

$$
Distance = Time × SpeedOfSound
$$

We know that `SpeedOfSound = 340m/s = 0.034cm/µs`

So the formula becomes:

$$
Distance = Time × 0.034
$$

>💡Note:
>
>We measure the pulse duration of the wave emitted by the HC-SR04, which corresponds to twice the time it takes for the sensor to reach the object and return. So in order to get the real distance between the sensor an the object you need to devide by 2.
>
>$$
>{Distance = (Time × 0.034) \over 2}
>$$

  #### *2. Specifications:*
  - Required voltage for working: 5V
  - Required current for working: 15mA
  - Frequency: 40kHz
  - The range: 2cm to 4m
  - Ranging Accuracy: 3mm

  #### *3. Mounting:* 
  
<p align="center">

</p>

  #### *4. Code Functions:*
- The length of the pulse (in microseconds) or 0 if no pulse started:
```ino
pulseIn(echoPin, HIGH)
```

### II- LED RGB:
>>>>>>>>>> ---
   #### *1. Introduction:*
  
 <p align="center">
    <img alt="LED RGB" width=49% src="https://github.com/irhesri/Smart-Irrigation-System/blob/main/Part3%3A%20Monitoring%20the%20water%20level%20in%20the%20tank/Equipements/LED%20RGB.jpg">
    <img alt="Resistance" width=49% src="https://github.com/irhesri/Smart-Irrigation-System/blob/main/Part3%3A%20Monitoring%20the%20water%20level%20in%20the%20tank/Equipements/Resistance.jpg">
  </p>

In order to mount an LED, resistors are needed to limit the amount of current flowing through the LED and prevent it from burning out.

- We can use Ohm's Law to calculate the resistance (R) needed:

$$
  R = {V_{source} - V_{LED} \over I_{LED}}
$$

> V<sub>source</sub> is the supply voltage.
> 
> V<sub>LED</sub> is the forward voltage drop of the LED.
> 
> I<sub>LED</sub> is the desired current through the LED.

$$\eqalign {
R_{R} &= {5V - 2V \over 0.02A} \\
&= 150Ω
}$$

$$\eqalign {
R_{G} &= R_{B} \\
&= {5V - 3V \over 0.02A} \\
&= 100Ω
}$$

> So we gonna use one resistor of 150Ω and 2 resistors of 100Ω.

  #### *2. Specifications:*
  - Required voltage for working: R:2-2.2V | G:3-3.2V | B:3-3.2V
  - Max current: 20mA

  #### *3. Mounting:*

</p>

  #### *4. Code Functions:*
-Write an analog value to a pin (turn it on or off). 
```ino
analogWrite(ColorPin, x);
```
x between 0 - 255.
